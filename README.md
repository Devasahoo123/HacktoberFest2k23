## 4. Wait for Pull Request to merge

## 5. Celebrate - You've Completed Your First Pull Request!

```python
'''
Always aim to make more than 4 pull requests during Hacktoberfest.
Even if you've submitted just 4 pull requests to different projects,
if one project is excluded from the Hacktoberfest event, your pull request won't count.
Ensure that the remaining 3 pull requests are to projects that are not excluded.
Fulfilling the requirement of 4 pull requests is essential to receive swags or t-shirts.
Consider making a pull request to your own repository, which is a very safe option.
Make sure the repository has the Hacktoberfest topic.
